#### Purpose of the practice
Understand concepts and achieve intelligent and practical resolution of problems. Accept multiplicity of valid responses to a problem.


Answer the following questions based on what we’ve seen in class and research if necessary.

1) What is a problem? Is it important to describe the context in which I am to solve it? How do you call the facts that we enunciate to complete the understanding of the problem? Is the problem the same for all people who analyze it? Why?

2) List the steps required to resolve the following situations:
•	Prepare and eat a fried egg.
•	Rent and watch a movie.
•	Go to a movie at the theatre.

3)  Explain the steps you normally take to solve a problem.

4) A man found to fly in his coffee and sent his coffee back to the kitchen. When the waiter returned with a new cup of coffee, the man took a sip and immediately knew that the waiter had just removed the fly and given him back the same cup of coffee. How did the man know that he was not served a fresh cup of coffee?

	
5) Some months have 31 days, others have 30, how many have 28?

6) A man is trapped in a room. The room has only two possible exits: two doors. Through the first door there is a room constructed from magnifying glass. The blazing hot sun instantly fries anything or anyone that enters. Through the second door there is a fire-breathing dragon. How does the man escape?

#### Goal of the practice
Become familiar with the writing of algorithms in pseudo code, expressions, operands, operators, assignments, conditionals and the elementary logic required to program.


1)	What is the difference between the contents of a variable and its name?

2)	 What is the difference between a variable, a constant and a literal? What do they have in common?

3)	What is an expression?

4)	What are the elements in an assignment?

5)	Debug the following assignments, writing the value that the variable gets in each assignment.

X <- 0
X <- X + 4
X <- X + X – X * X
X <- X mod 4
X <- (x + 4) div 2


6)	Determine the operands (specifying which type of operand is), and operators (specifying their name) of the following expressions. Group with parentheses to clarify which operations are performed first.

Number: x,y,a,n
const Number: PI = 3,1416 
const Number: COFACTOR = 1

PI + x / 2
y
x + y – a
n mod 2 == 0
COFACTOR * x > 20
COFACTOR

Assuming that x <- 10, y <- 10, n <- 4 and a <- 1
Calculate the expressions and write the results.

7)	Write an algorithm to read a number by keyboard and say if it is positive or negative.

8)	Perform an algorithm to read a number and report if it is greater, equal or less than zero.

9)	Write an algorithm that determines if a number is even.

10)	Make an algorithm to read two real numbers and print the largest of them.

11)	Given the radius of a circle, make an algorithm to calculate the value of the area.

12)	Write an algorithm that determines if an "N" number is divisible by another "M".

13)	Write an algorithm to translate a time expressed in days, hours, minutes and seconds to time expressed in seconds.

14)	We are being informed of three environmental temperature values, and we are asked to develop an algorithm to calculate and report the sum and average of these values.

15)	For our brave ones: translate a time expressed in seconds to a time expressed in days, hours, minutes and seconds.
