## Student's Individual Project
Each student will build an application of their own choice. It should be a web application with functional back end and front end. 
- Example applications could be: A Banking System, A Rock-Paper-Scissor game, A School System, Inventory Management System, A simple Ecommerce Store, etc.  
- You will use your own Github account to host your project, you will need to email me your Github account on or before **June 8th, 2018**
- You will need to submit a Project Proposal that will briefly describe what you have chosen to build on **June 20th, 2018**
- We will simulate a *"2-week sprint"* in which you will have to provide me an update on your project **every 2 weeks**
- If you are unable to come up with an idea of what you should be building, please ask! I'll be very happy to help!
