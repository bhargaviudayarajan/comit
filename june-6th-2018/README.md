### Alan Turing: The Father of Modern Computer Science
> Alan Turing is considered by many to be the father of modern computer science as the world knows it. He formed the concept of the algorithms and computations with one of his inventions, the Turing machine.

The Turing machine is described in this paper by Alan Turing: 
> ON COMPUTABLE NUMBERS, WITH AN APPLICATION TO THE ENTSCHEIDUNGSPROBLEM
https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf

The paper involves a lot of mathematical knowledge, so if you're interested, you can read **The Annotated Turing** by *Charles Petzold* instead, where he goes and explains the background of what Turing is referring to in his paper. 


Happy Learning!
